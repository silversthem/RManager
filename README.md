# RManager
Little online task manager web app.

## About 
The app is created using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for design
and [simPHPle](https://github.com/silversthem/simPHPle) in the back-end.

### Progress 
Currently there's only a prototype for the design.
Here's a screenshot of the beginning of the user interface :
